# ml_test

This repository contains binary and multiclass classifier.In this repo,i tried to implement machine learning algorithms,LSTM,word embedding(fasttext) and transformer based model for text classifications.

As a word embedding i used fasttest pretrained bangla embedding in LSTM.here is the link below of the pretrain embedding model
